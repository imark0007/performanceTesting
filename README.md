# Performance Testing Project

![Project Logo](https://www.xenonstack.com/hubfs/xenonstack-performance-testing-tools.png)

## Overview

This project is aimed at conducting performance testing of web applications using industry-standard tools and methodologies. It helps in identifying performance bottlenecks, analyzing system behavior under various load conditions, and ensuring that the application meets performance requirements.

## Features

- **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to determine the system's behavior under expected and peak load conditions.
- **Stress Testing**: Perform stress testing to evaluate the system's robustness and stability under extreme load conditions.
- **Scalability Testing**: Assess the system's ability to handle increased workload by adding resources or scaling horizontally.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor key performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
- **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive performance reports with graphical representations for analysis and decision-making.

## Tools Used

- **Apache JMeter**: An open-source tool for load testing and performance measurement.
- **Gatling**: A highly scalable load testing framework for web applications.
- **New Relic**: A monitoring tool for application performance management.
- **Grafana**: A visualization tool for monitoring and analyzing performance metrics.
